First round of selling furniture before moving!

1) 
![wooden and metal folding chairs](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/applaro-chair-outdoor__0131143_PE285690_S4.JPG)

Two wooden & metal folding chairs from Ikea. These are the "ÄPPLARÖ" outdoor chair, but I've been using them super successfully indoors for additional seating for larger parties and the like. They're great, fold small and into your closet. They're in awesome shape. Bought new for $35 each, yours for $30 for one, or $55 for the pair.

2) 
![chartreuse green wingback chair](https://github.com/zmagg/zmagg.github.io/blob/master/images/IMG_4601%20(1).jpg)
This chair is amazing. Chartreuse green with gold highlights. Classic wingback style, adds a pop of color to any space. The seat cushion could be replaced with something more supportive, and is easily done (zippered-seat cushion). Some rips. Yours for $120.

3) 
![tables1](https://github.com/zmagg/zmagg.github.io/blob/master/images/IMG_4632.jpg)
Selling both of these large worktables. These are amazing large workspaces to spread out your art / focus your mind on your small laptop with a nice blank space surrounding it. IKEA Gerton/Lerberg http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S09046428/. Great condition, very heavy. I did some finishing with some butcher block oil (linseed based). Bought new for $120 each. Yours for $100 each or $180 for both. 

4) 
![dresser](https://github.com/zmagg/zmagg.github.io/blob/master/images/IMG_0848.JPG)
Tiny two door dresser. It's upside down in this photo, but not in real life, and you can place it right side up in your home. The drawers are a little bit sticky. $10

5)
![desk](https://github.com/zmagg/zmagg.github.io/blob/master/images/IMG_4617.jpg)
Slanted writing desk. Has storage. Dimensions: 36'' x 25'' x 32'' (with a 3'' slope, so the lowest point in the desk is 29'' high). $20

6)
![nightstand](https://github.com/zmagg/zmagg.github.io/blob/master/images/IMG_4624.jpg)
Mostly used this nightstand as a side table. Has some water stains that could be gotten rid of. Lovely ornate top and style. Big fan, too heavy to move across the country. $20
