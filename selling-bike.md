Hi friends,

I'm contemplating selling one of my bikes. If I'm being honest with myself, the frame is too big, and my choices are really to sell it whole or to buy a new frame and rebuild it.


I'd like $600 for it. It was last serviced at the lovely 718 cyclery about 200 miles ago.


### Bike spec:


#### the frame:
1978 Olmo competition with wonderful details.

**aesthetics**: Primary color blue, original stickers (one says 1978 Campione D'italie!), pretty engraved star-shaped & OLMO [stamps](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k8xmigeK3iE/Tjgm7UKYeQI/AAAAAAAAACw/20y-W510WFo/s576/PICT0305.JPG) throughout.


**technical details**: There's a tiny (smaller than a dime) dent in the side of the top tube, from a shipping accident a year ago. I think it's still structurally sound, but if this is a dealbreaker for you, we can get a second or third opinion from a framebuilder.


* 54 cm top tube length
* 51 cm center-to-top length
* My guess is that it would fit someone 5'5''->5'10''.  30 inch standover height (If you know your pants inseam, you want your inseam to at least clear this).

**the components:**
* OLMO stamped fork.
* Suntour Superbe brake levers (w/ pretty cut-outs!), brakes, and shifters.
* Suntour Superbe cranks.
* 1970s track-style 3TTT stem and bars. They're similar to [these](http://www.velobase.com/ViewComponent.aspx?ID=527c40d8-02d1-44ed-ad0b-12a4183335e5).
* Shimano 105 rear derailleur
* Shimano Tiagra rear hub, pretty heavy wheelset back there. I've been meaning to replace it.
* Gipiemme front hub (came with the bike)
* Unclear what the front derailleur is, it's unmarked and I've never had to do work on it.


It's currently set up as a friction shifter, but it's the smoothest shifting bike I've ever ridden.


* MKS stream pedals, shellac'd yellow bar tape that honestly should probably be replaced soon.


If you don't have any gear, I can throw in a helmet, bike u-lock, and front-and-rear light package (sweet USB-charging, look-like-you're-as-bright-as-a-car ones) for some extra $$, just let me know.


This bike has lived in Oakland, San Francisco, Brooklyn, Queens and Carrboro NC. Probably more places to, before I bought it.


OH WAIT you probably want photos.

Here are some photos:

LOOK HOW MUCH FUN YOU COULD HAVE.

Email me off-list if you're interested in giving it a trial ride.
