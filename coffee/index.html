<p>I drink coffee and move a lot. Here are some recommendations.</p>

<p>When possible, I avoid espresso in favor of anything else, so if you want espresso recs, you should go <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~justine/coffee.html">ask my friend Justine</a>. Some of these cities I qualify as &ldquo;avoid drip coffee, drink espresso.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>San Francisco Bay</h1>

<h3>San Francisco</h3>

<p>San Francisco-proper has pretty good coffee, the problem is the prices. Starting at $3 for a 12 oz. pour over is a bit steep (IMO), especially when not every barista is equally great at producing a good cup. I won&rsquo;t bother to recommend the usual triumvirate (4Barrel, Ritual, Blue Bottle) for this reason. If you want it, you know where to go. Here are some alternatives, that I think are just as good if not better:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="mercurycafe.com/">Mercury Cafe</a>, in Hayes Valley, just up the road from the Ritual &amp; Blue bottle stands. They use de la Paz beans, will sell &lsquo;em to you for $12/lb (price from mid-2013) and have a great drip &amp; iced coffee. Very sweet spot to hang out in and use the wifi, lots of sunlight, not to mention great food.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sightglass-coffee-san-francisco">Sightglass</a>. Best pour over in SF. Very&hellip;&ldquo;Silicon Valley North&rdquo;, the space is full of Luluemon, venture capitalists, glazed over concrete and succulents, but the coffee is worth spending time in the atmosphere I promise.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.contrabandcoffeebar.com/home.html">Contraband</a>. Did I say that Sightglass has the best pour over in SF? Contraband gives them a run for their money. In lower Nob Hill area, really wonderful place, really wonderful coffee. I had an amazing Indonesian cup here once that I can still remember&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/hollow-san-francisco">Hollow</a>, in the Inner Sunset. I actually think I&rsquo;ve only ever gotten espresso drinks here, but they were great.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/trouble-coffee-company-san-francisco/">Trouble Coffee</a>, Outer Sunset. Great coffee to walk to the beach with.</li>
</ul>


<h3>East Bay</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="local123cafe.com/">Local 123</a>. Prices steep, probably as a result of the 4Barrel beans they serve, but it&rsquo;s a really nice shop with a great backyard. I try to stop in every other visit to Berkeley. Best chocolate chip cookie I&rsquo;ve ever had. Not sure where they source them.</li>
</ul>


<h3>South Bay</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://barefootcoffee.com/">Barefoot Coffee</a>. There&rsquo;s a few locations, it&rsquo;s the only coffee-shop-atmosphere in 30 miles and they also make a great brew.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Peninsula</h3>

<ul>
<li>Only in Palo Alto, is the only good coffee in a combination running store coffee bar. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/zombierunner-palo-alto-2">Zombie Runner</a>&rsquo;s the jam, they keep weird hours though.</li>
</ul>


<h1>New York City</h1>

<h3>Lower Manhattan</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://everymanespresso.com/">Everyman Espresso</a>. It hurts to pay $6 for a chemex, it really does, but when in Manhattan... (This coffee is great, the baristas know what's up and they carry Counter Culture which is like the key to my heart.)</li>
<li><a href="http://joetheartofcoffee.com/">Joe Coffee</a>, all of &lsquo;em.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Brooklyn</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-grumpy-brooklyn-3">Grumpy&rsquo;s</a> in Greenpoint. I haven&rsquo;t been to the other Grumpy&rsquo;s locations, but this one is spacious enough to do some serious cafe shop (co-)working.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.croptocup.com">Crop to Cup</a> in Gowanus. A friend and I refer to this as the "best keep secret in Brooklyn", and it certainly feels like that with excellent, excellent pour overs of mostly Ugandan coffee for the low cost of $2.50 a cup. Also there's almost no one ever there. Also they have a backyard. Also the coffee is maybe the best in this entire list. Go.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-pedlar-brooklyn-2">Pedlar</a> in Cobble Hill has maybe my favorite latte in all of Brooklyn.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Queens</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetleaf-long-island-city">Sweetleaf</a> in Long Island City. There's two of 'em, and the one closer to the water serves cocktails after 5PM. Ever wanted a delicious Revolver? Go there. The coffee is quite good too, but I find their specialty drinks more consistent than their drip coffee.
</ul>

<h1>Hudson Valley</h1>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://banksquarecoffeehouse.com/">Bank Square Coffee</a> in Beacon. Really solid drip brew.</li>
	<li><a href="http://fishkillfarms.com/">Fishkill Farms</a> in Fishkill. Not technically a coffee shop, but the farmhouse serves apple cider doughnuts (in season) and an amazingly solid drip coffee to drink with.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Ontario</h1>

<h3>Toronto</h3>

<p>Somehow, despite the Green Beanery, this city is definitely filed under, avoid drip, drink espresso. I haven&rsquo;t lived here since 2009 though, so it&rsquo;s entirely possible there&rsquo;s been a sea shift.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.darkhorseespressobar.com/">Dark Horse Espresso Bar!!</a> Back when I was living in Toronto in 2009, they only had the cheerfuly lit Chinatown branch, but the internet tells me they&rsquo;ve expanded to 2 others! Go! Go! What are you waiting for??</li>
<li><a href="http://www.maniccoffee.com/">Manic Coffee</a>. I remember taking the subway an extra 20 minutes (one way!) so I could get a cup here after work.  I think this was the first place I saw a pour over and I was all boggle-eyed.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Ottawa</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/117468388785923646368/about?gl=us&hl=en">Ministry of Coffee</a> On Elgin, near downtown. Totally delightful shop, great brews, lots of outlets. </li>
<li><a href="http://rawsugarcafe.tumblr.com/">Raw Sugar Cafe</a> Back in 2010 when I first went to this place, I was struck by a disorientation: hipsters were gentrifying Chinatown.</li>
</li>
	
</ul>


<h1>North Carolina</h1>

<h3>Chapel Hill / Carrboro</h3>

<p>I can wax poetic for hours on the Piedmont&rsquo;s excellent, excellent drip coffee. I think some of it is the pressure from having Counter Culture roasted locally&mdash;everybody else steps their game up!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.caffedriade.com/">Caffe Driade</a> / <a href="http://www.openeyecafe.com/">Open Eye</a>
Owned by the same folks, and they use the same beans (Carrboro Roasting Company). Driade has a super pleasant patio out into the woods to sit on and you pay for the wi-fi (2013). In contrast, Open Eye is more of an undergraduate collegiate hangout. Good memories, but it&rsquo;s startling how much demographic shit has occurred even in 4 years. Pastries from Gugulhupf.</li>
<li><a href="http://cafecarrboro.com/">Looking Glass</a>
With approximately 100 more outlets than Open Eye, this place is the jam for computer-work. Great iced coffee.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cary (RTP)</h3>

<p>You might be scoffing at this, but seriously, one of the best lattes I&rsquo;ve ever gotten was at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/crema-coffee-roaster-and-espresso-bar-cary">this shop</a> off Davis Drive.</p>
