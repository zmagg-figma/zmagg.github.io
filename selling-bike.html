<p>Hi friends,</p>

<p>I'm contemplating selling one of my bikes. If I'm being honest with myself, the frame is too big, and my choices are really to sell it whole or to buy a new frame and rebuild it.</p>

<p>I'd like $600 for it. It was last serviced at the lovely 718 cyclery about 200 miles ago.</p>

<h3>Bike spec:</h3>

<h4>the frame:</h4>

<p>1978 Olmo competition with wonderful details.</p>

<p><strong>aesthetics</strong>: Primary color blue, original stickers (one says 1978 Campione D'italie!), pretty engraved star-shaped &amp; OLMO <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k8xmigeK3iE/Tjgm7UKYeQI/AAAAAAAAACw/20y-W510WFo/s576/PICT0305.JPG">stamps</a> throughout.</p>

<p><strong>technical details</strong>: There's a tiny (smaller than a dime) dent in the side of the top tube, from a shipping accident a year ago. I think it's still structurally sound, but if this is a dealbreaker for you, we can get a second or third opinion from a framebuilder.</p>

<ul>
<li>54 cm top tube length</li>
<li>51 cm center-to-top length</li>
<li>My guess is that it would fit someone 5'5''->5'10''.  30 inch standover height (If you know your pants inseam, you want your inseam to at least clear this).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>the components</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>OLMO stamped fork.</li>
<li>Suntour Superbe brake levers (w/ pretty cut-outs!), brakes, and shifters.</li>
<li>Suntour Superbe cranks.</li>
<li>1970s track-style 3TTT stem and bars. They're similar to <a href="http://www.velobase.com/ViewComponent.aspx?ID=527c40d8-02d1-44ed-ad0b-12a4183335e5">these</a>.</li>
<li>Shimano 105 rear derailleur</li>
<li>Shimano Tiagra rear hub, pretty heavy wheelset back there. I've been meaning to replace it.</li>
<li>Gipiemme front hub (came with the bike)</li>
<li>Unclear what the front derailleur is, it's unmarked and I've never had to do work on it.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's currently set up as a friction shifter, but it's the smoothest shifting bike I've ever ridden.</p>

<ul>
<li>MKS stream pedals, shellac'd yellow bar tape that honestly should probably be replaced soon.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't have any gear, I can throw in a helmet, bike u-lock, and front-and-rear light package (sweet USB-charging, look-like-you're-as-bright-as-a-car ones) for some extra $$, just let me know.</p>

<p>This bike has lived in Oakland, San Francisco, Brooklyn, Queens and Carrboro NC. Probably more places to, before I bought it.</p>

<p>OH WAIT you probably want photos.</p>

<p>Here are some photos:</p>

<p>LOOK HOW MUCH FUN YOU COULD HAVE.</p>

<p>Email me off-list if you're interested in giving it a trial ride.</p>
